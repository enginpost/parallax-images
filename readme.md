#Parallax-images

Parallax images is a jQuery plugin that allows you to implement traditional images
in a webpage while calling a single function  to convert the images into a parallaxing
presentation of images that slide vertically within themselves when the page scrolls.

In addition to the parallaxing scroll presentation, hovering the image with a mouse
causes the image to expand to present it entirely, while the mouse-out event causes
the image to return to the appropriate amount of parallax based on the page scroll.
