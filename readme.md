#Parallax-images

##What it does
Parallax images is a **jQuery plugin** that allows you to implement traditional images
in a webpage while calling a single function  to convert the images into a parallaxing
presentation of images that slide vertically within themselves when the page scrolls.

In addition to the *parallaxing scroll* presentation, the plugin adds a mouse-over event
causing the image to *expand to present it entirely*, while the mouse-out event causes
the image to return to the appropriate amount of parallax based on the page scroll.
